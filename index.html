A console screen is a combination of a display monitor and an input device, typically a keyboard and/or mouse. 
It allows users to input commands and receive visual output from a computer or computer system easily.
You can open it through Visual Studio Code simply by coding for the console screen and clicking "Go Live". If you are on a different website though, this depends on the keyboard shortcut for your browser.
You can print anything in console by using Console.log() function and by making predefined variables.
